# ESP8266 setup and control

This is a complementary project to another project of mine 'Non-Touch-Light-Switch--...'
Thanks to the Californium project and ESPTouch that allowed me to seamlessly talk to my switch using CoAP.

ESP chip needs:

 a username/password and a WIFI point to connect to
 and a network point to listen and send its reports to.
